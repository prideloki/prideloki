                <p>There are certain apps that people use everyday or couldn’t live without them. Some of them are social media apps.
But I would like to share my productive apps.</p>

<p><a href="http://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a>
These app helps me get rid of bookmarks for read later. Whenever i find an interesting article, i usually use the pocket chrome extension. the chrome extension is easy to use, just click the icon and it will save the article. I can read articles on any devices like PC(Website, Mac), Mobile(iPad,iPhone). On my iPhone, i can share an article to pocket as well. I love that this app is on any devices and it syncs nicely with other devices. The saved articles on my pocket app keep growing so I tried to read some of them while I am commuting. I would recommend my friends who keep lots of tabs on their browser to use Pocket. It saves you times.</p>

<p><a href="http://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a>
this is the most popular note-taking platform. I love <a href="https://www.google.co.th/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAAahUKEwjhm-Pz8-PGAhUSCI4KHZAhDLw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fevernote.com%2Fwebclipper%2F&amp;ei=cd6pVaGfJJKQuASQw7DgCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVwQ7jyQWRmUhwkrNbfL-pCvv2lw&amp;sig2=ZgkuKbb6-RMoVy9HWeUsbA&amp;bvm=bv.98197061,d.c2E" target="_blank">their Web clipper chrome extension.</a> I can’t live without it.
It makes saving content on website more easier. I keep those content for later references.
I also keep my journals and goals on Evernote. Tips for those who can’t seem to stick with writing Journal, I suggest you to use the <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/133689-daily-evernote-journal-template" target="_blank">IFTT service to create your note everyday at a certain time.</a> That will cut the cost of creating note everyday so you can focus on start writing Journal instead. I’m a premium Evernote user. I have faced issues a couple time with my syncing notes. I had contacted a customer support service. They helped me as much as they could to solve my issues since I provided them detailed steps I took to produce issue and solve issues( they don’t have the right to access my note content so I have to fix it myself with their helpful instructions).</p>

<p><a href="http://asana.com/" target="_blank">Asana</a>
Asana is a project management application. But you can use for your personal management.
I’ve been using Asana for almost a year. What I love about Asana is the <a href="https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/my-tasks" target="_blank">My Tasks view</a>, there is a list divided by 4 sections: New Tasks, Today, Upcoming, Later. This allows me to focus on Today tasks and see what tasks are waiting for me in the Upcoming section. I can promote my tasks from Upcoming to Today if I want to and put them back if there are more important and urgent tasks come up.</p>

<p>This is my very first blog, Plus my English is my second language.
Hope whom ever come across this blog find this useful though ;P</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>
